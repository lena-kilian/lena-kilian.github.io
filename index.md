# About

I am a Research Fellow in Consumption-Based Accounting in the Sustainability Research Institute. My work looks at estimating and analysing consumption-based emissions. My work focuses on analysing household emissions, particularly how these can be reduced without furtherin sociel inequalities. Moreover, I work directly on the UK’s model to estimate consumption-based emissions. My work is funded through the [Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence (ESCoE)](https://www.escoe.ac.uk/).

In 2023, I completed an ESRC-funded 2+2 MSc + PhD programme at the University of Leeds as part of the ESRC-funded [Data Analytics and Society CDT](https://datacdt.org/). The focus of my PhD research was on consumption-based emissions of UK households. In addition to this I have an MSc from King’s College London in Sustainable Cities and a BSc from the University of Glasgow in Psychology with Sociology.
