I am postgraduate student in the School of Geography at the University of Leeds, based at the [Leeds Insititue of Data Analytics](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/). I am part of the ESRC-funded [Data Analytics and Society CDT](https://datacdt.org/) and am currrently in my first year of year of a 2+2 MSc and PhD programme. I have previously completed a BSc in Psychology with outside papers in Sociology at the University of Glasgow and an MSc in Geography at King's College London.

My current research looks at spatial energy footprints in the UK. More specifically, we aim to investigate links between geodemographic data and energy consumption. Information about the project will be updated regularly on my [univerity profile](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/pgr/2546/lena-kilian).
