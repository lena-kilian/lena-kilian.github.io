I am postgraduate student in the School of Geography at the University of Leeds, based at the [Leeds Insititue of Data Analytics](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/). I am part of the ESRC-funded [Data Analytics and Society CDT](https://datacdt.org/) and am currrently in my first year of year of a 2+2 MSc and PhD programme. I have previously completed a BSc in Psychology with outside papers in Sociology at the University of Glasgow and an MSc in Geography at King's College London. More information about my background can be found [here](https://lena-kilian.github.io/cv/).

My current research looks at spatial energy footprints in the UK. More specifically, we aim to investigate links between geodemographic data and energy consumption. My main project supervisors are [Dr. Anne Owen](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/see/staff/1462/dr-anne-owen) and [Dr. Andy Newing](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/staff/1081/dr-andy-newing). More information about the project will be updated regularly on my [univerity profile](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/pgr/2546/lena-kilian).

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the social impacts on and the environmental impacts of energy consumption, as well as the  social and environmental effects of sustainable energy behaviour change policy.
