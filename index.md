# About

I am an assistant professor at the [Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML)](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/environmental-sciences) at Leiden University. My work focuses on using environmentally-extended input-output analysis to estimate and analyse consumption-based emissions. I am particularly interested in subnational distributions of emissions to assess carbon inequalities as well as spatial differences in footprints. Moreover, from 2022-2025 I worked on the UK’s model to estimate consumption-based emissions, which is used to calculate the [UK's carbon footprint](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint/carbon-footprint-for-the-uk-and-england-to-2019). 

Before joining Leiden University, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en) and at the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk). Before this, I completed an ESRC-funded 2+2 MSc + PhD programme at the University of Leeds as part of the ESRC-funded [Data Analytics and Society CDT](https://datacdt.org/). The focus of my PhD research was on consumption-based emissions of UK households. In addition to this I have an MSc from King’s College London in Sustainable Cities and a BSc from the University of Glasgow in Psychology with Sociology.
