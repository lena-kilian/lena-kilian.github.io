I am postgraduate research student in the School of Geography at the University of Leeds, based at the [Leeds Insititue of Data Analytics](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/). I am part of the ESRC-funded [Data Analytics and Society CDT](https://datacdt.org/) and am currrently in my second year of a 2+2 MSc and PhD programme. I have previously completed a BSc in Psychology with Sociology at the University of Glasgow and an MSc in Geography at King's College London. More information about my background can be found [here](https://lena-kilian.github.io/cv/).

My research looks at UK household's greenhouse gas emissions. More specifically, we aim to estimate conssumption-based footprints longitudinally at neighbourhood level and then investigate temporal and spatial patterns. This allows for an analysis of the links between geodemographic data and energy consumption, as well as the impact of policy changes and local infrastructure on emissions. My main project supervisors are [Dr. Anne Owen](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/see/staff/1462/dr-anne-owen), [Dr. Andy Newing](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/staff/1081/dr-andy-newing) and [Dr Diana Ivanova](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/see/staff/2625/dr-diana-ivanova). More information about the project will be updated regularly on my [university profile](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/pgr/2546/lena-kilian).
