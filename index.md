# About

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en). My work looks at transformation pathways to meet the Sustainable Development Goals and to safeguard Planetary Boundaries. 

Until March 2025, I was a Research Fellow in Consumption-Based Accounting at the [Sustainability Research Institute](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/sustainability-research-institute) at the University of Leeds. Here, I looked at estimating and analysing consumption-based emissions, with a focus on analysing household emissions. Moreover, I worked on the UK’s model to estimate consumption-based emissions, which is used to calculate the [UK's carbon footprint](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint/carbon-footprint-for-the-uk-and-england-to-2019). 

Before this, I completed an ESRC-funded 2+2 MSc + PhD programme at the University of Leeds as part of the ESRC-funded [Data Analytics and Society CDT](https://datacdt.org/). The focus of my PhD research was on consumption-based emissions of UK households. In addition to this I have an MSc from King’s College London in Sustainable Cities and a BSc from the University of Glasgow in Psychology with Sociology.
