This model is part of an [assessment](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-phd/assessment1/index.html) for [GEOG5995](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-phd/index.html). It creates *n* agents, which are located randomly on a 300 x 300 grid. In this example the agents represent sheep, which will move around and interact with an imported environment, as well as each other.
