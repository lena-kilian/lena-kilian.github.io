### 1. Agent-based modelling  
This model is part of an [assessment](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-phd/assessment1/index.html) for [GEOG5995](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-phd/index.html). It creates *n* agents, which are located randomly on a 300 x 300 grid. In this example the agents represent sheep, which will move around and interact with an imported environment, as well as each other. 

The final model will create an animation as depicted in *Figure 1*

_*Notes: This figure contains some snapshots of the model at different times and not the whole sequence._
